This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in React Router Dom v6 and above, specifically concerning how it handles navigation to routes that are not explicitly defined. The initial `App.js` shows a missing route for `/contact`.  Navigating to this missing route leads to unexpected behaviour.  The corrected `AppSolution.js` demonstrates how to handle this elegantly using a catch-all route for a 404 page.
